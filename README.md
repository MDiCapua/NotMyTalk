# NotMyTalk
NotMyTalk is a Prolog tool for NLP based on WordNet lexical database.

This program is a modified version of MyTalk program, 
created by Lorenzo Rosa, in turn inspired by the Talk 
program presented  in "Prolog and natural-language 
analysis" (Pereira and Shieber, 1987). 
The main revisions concern the VERBS and the phrase 
structure. 

Give in input the string "main_loop()." in order to run 
the program.
