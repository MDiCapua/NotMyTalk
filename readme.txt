NotMyTalk is a Prolog tool for NLP based on WordNet lexical database.

This program is a modified version of MyTalk program, 
created by Lorenzo Rosa, in turn inspired by the Talk 
program presented in "Prolog and natural-language analysis" 
(Pereira and Shieber, 1987). 
The main revisions concern the VERBS and the phrase structure.

This program has been tested using SWI-Prolog (threaded, 64 bits, version 8.2.4).

In order to run it, open "notMyTalk.pl" and give in input the string "main_loop()."
